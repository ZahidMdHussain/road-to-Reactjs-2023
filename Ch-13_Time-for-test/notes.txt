1. What are differnt type of testing?
A. > Manual testing
   > Antomation testing
   > End to End testing
   > Unit testing
   > Integration testing

2. What is Enzyme?
A. Enzyme is a javascript testing utility that makes it easier to assert, manipulate and traverse
   your react component output.

3. Enzyme vs React testing library.
A. Major difference are :
    1. Conceptual : In enzyme we are testing using state and props of the components.
                    where as in using react testing library we test the components from user's prespective like how user would interact with our application.

    2. Shallow and deep rendring : In react testing libarary we test using the DOM, so there is 
                    now shallow or deep rendring, But in Enzyme shallow and deep rendring are present.

            Shallow > Shallow rendring enables us to that we are not asserting our test based on 
                behaviour of any child components of the compoents we are testing.
            
           deep > Enzyme provide us us with full rendring of DOM elements. It is usefull where 
                we want to test the components wrapped inside higher order components.

4. What is Jest and why do we use it?
A. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. 
   It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.
