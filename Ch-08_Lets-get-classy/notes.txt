1. How do you create nested Routes react-router-dom configration.
A.       const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
         {
            path : '/',
            element : <App />,
            children : [
                  {
                     path : '/profile',
                     element: <Profile />,
                     children : [
                        {
                           path: 'myintro',
                           element: <Intro />,
                        }
                     ]
                  },
                  {
                     path : '/contact',
                     element: <Contact />
                  }
            ]
         },
      ])

2. What is order of the life cycle method call in class based components?
A. There are 5 life cycle state of class components:
      i>   Constructor
      ii>  render method
      iii> componentDidMount
      iv>  componentDidUpdate
      v>   componentWillUnmount

3. Why do we use componentDidMount?
A. Since componentDidMount is called after intial render so we can use this function to call api or update state
   variable, which will render the UI with updated state. It is same as useEffect hook in functional components.

4. Why do we use componentWillUnmounted?  
A. componentWillUnmount is used to clear the memory associated with the component. Once the component is unloaded,  all
   variable associated to that component will be cleared.
   Like if we created interval under componentDidMount then we can clear that interval under componentDidUnmount once that component is unloaded.

   Example:
      componentDidMount(){
          this.interval = setInterval(() => {
            console.log("Interval is running");
         }, 1000);
      }

      componentDidUnmount(){
         clearInterval(this.interval);
         console.log("Interval cleared");
      }
