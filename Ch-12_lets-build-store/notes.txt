3. What is Context.Provider and Context.Consumer?
A. Every Context object comes with a Provider react component that allows all decendent components to inherit to 
   context changes. The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to all decendent components of Provider.
   One Provider can be connected to many consumers.

   Context.Consumer: A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe
   to a context within a function component.To apply context to class-based components we use Context.Consumer.

4. If we don't pass value to the provider does it take the default value?
