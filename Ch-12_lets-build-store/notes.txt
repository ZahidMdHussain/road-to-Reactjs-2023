1. Difference between useContext and Redux?
A. useContext is a hook that provide the way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props down 
   though each nested components.
   Redux is state management library, which manage the state and data of our applications.

   useContext make changes using context value 
   Redux make changes using pure function i.e Reducers.

   useContext is better to be use with small applications
   Redux is perfect for large applications.

2. Advantage of using Redux toolkit over Redux.
A. Redux toolkit solve 3 common concern about Redux.
    > Configuring Redux store is too complicated.
    > We have to add lot's of package to get Redux to do something useful.
    > Redux require too much boilerplate code.

3. Explain despatcher?
A. Despatcher is action which is when added to any UI element, then on UI action, despatcher is triggerd which inturn calls
   the reducer function of redux.

4. Explain Reducer?
A. Reducer is a redux function which update the slice of redux store. 

5. Explain Slice?
A. Slice are like small container inside the store, these slice perform specific functionality when reducer function 
   is triggered.

6. Explain Selector?
A. Selector is hook that use to subscribe our UI element to store so that we can reflect the state management into 
   our apps. useSelector is hook which act as bridge between store and UI elements.

7. Explain createSlice and configuration it takes.
A.  > We create slice using createSlice function which comes from redux toolkit.
    > create Slice takes into 3 values name, initialState and reducers.
    > reducers is a object that will conatins action and reducer function corresponding to that action.
    > At end will export all our action as named export from cartSlice.action.
    > Also, will export reducer from cartSlice.reducer

    Exapmple:

        import {createSlice} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

        const cartSlice = createSlice({
            name: "Cart,
            initialState: {
                items: []
            },
            reducers: {
                addItems: (state, action) => {
                    state.items.push(action.pyload)
                },
            }
        })

        export {addItems} from cartSlice.actions
        export default cartSlice.reducer
